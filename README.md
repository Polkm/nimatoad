# Nimatoad
A game engine written in Nim, that uses SDL2 and OpenGL.

If you want to make a game with Nimatoad then you are going to have to clone or fork this project.
Think of using Nimatoad as modding an existing game, you will most likely have to makes changes to the engine anyways, because there are plenty of unimplemented features.
